At first the game loop was created on one local pc. 
The loop lets one player type a word,
then the other has to type it off and vice versa.
Also a counter runs in the background.

Then some first draft of a gui has been created. 
One main button and a state schema , are concepts that fjiz wants to implement.

A Dialog should be created, to connect or host a game.

Wavy wants to have one ConnectionController to handle all the Socket stuff.


Still to do:

Sockets only work half heartly. The next Step would be to connect the game with the Sockets.

Then to connect the Gui with the Game.

Then maybe implement a database.
